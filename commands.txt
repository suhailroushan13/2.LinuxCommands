In Linux the shell (or terminal) is the lifeline of the developer, and of any power user. Things which can be done on
the GUI (by clicking on different buttons), can be done much more efficiently on the terminal by using commands.
Maybe one can not remember all the commands, but with regular usage one can easily remember the most useful ones.


///////////////1ST CHAPTER(Shell Commands)////////////////////////////////

1. [username@hostname directoryname]

username - suhail

pwd : pwd command, short for print working directory, will help you to find 
out the absolute path of the current directory

7.cd command
cd :  cd, short for change directory. This command will help you to change your current

8.cd .. command
The above command changes the current directory to the parent directory.

9. ls command
ls : ls command to list the files and directories inside any given directory. 
If you use ls command without any argument, then it will work on the current directory. 

10.mkdir command
We can create new directories using mkdir command.
mkdir suhailroushan

11.rm command is used to remove a file, or directory. The -r option is being used to remove in a recursive way. With -f
you force the removal, ignoring errors and never prompt. You can chain the flags, so instead of rm -r -f you can as
well type rm -rf. But, always double check before you use rm -rf command, if you by mistake give this command in
your home directory, or any other important directory, it will not ask to confirm, but it will delete everything there. So,
please be careful and read twice before pressing enter key.

rm -rf hello.txt
rm -rf Folder 

12. cp command 
We use the cp command to copy a file in the Linux shell. To copy a folder with its contents recursively use the cp
command with the -r flag. We use the cp file_to_copy new_location format. In the example below, we are copying the
hello.txt to hello2.txt.

cp 1.txt 2.txt 

If there is a alternative path then provide the absolute path to it with

-r is use for recursively copying the files 


cp -r hello.txt /home/suhail/Work



13.The mv command is used to rename or move a file or directory.
In the following example, the file hello.txt is renamed
to nothello.txt.

mv hello.txt bye.txt // Renaming the file hello.txt to bye.txt
mv hello.txt /home/suhail/Work // Move the file to /home/suhail/Work

echo "Hello World!"

17 | pipe command 
In Linux shells, we can redirect the command output to a file, or as input to another command. The pipe operator | is
the most common way to do so. Using this we can now count the number of directories in the root (/) directory very
easily.


ls | wc -w |
It redirect the output to the next command

/////////////////////// 2ND CHAPTER FHS /////////////////////////
/ is the root directory of your file system. It’s under this directory, that all the other files and directories reside. There’s a
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS), which talks about these different directories, and what kinds of files are located
in which directory.
